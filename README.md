Custom Adminer
==============

Our custom all-in-one configuration of **Adminer database tool**. It contains responsive touch-friendly theme and a couple of useful plugins.

## End of life 
This project is almost at the end of its life. We switched to ðŸ‘‰ [our own Adminer fork](https://github.com/pematon/adminer) ðŸ‘ˆ some time ago and now we are moving forward to version 5. This will include a new theme and configuration that will replace [adminer-theme](https://github.com/pematon/adminer-theme) and all plugins in [adminer-plugins](https://github.com/pematon/adminer-plugins).

## Compatibility
Minimal requirements are: PHP 5.6, Adminer 4.4, modern web browser.

## How to use
Just download whole package to public directory on your web server. Optionally you can configure plugins in index.php.
